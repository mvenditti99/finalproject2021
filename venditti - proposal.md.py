# Preproposal

## I will be composing a song using multiple different AI music softwares,
such as Magenta Studio and Music Transformer

## I am not collaborating with any classmates

## To Do List
- compose motif by editing project magenta code
- use music transformer to elaborate on motif
- use project magenta code to create other instruments possibly, such as
drums, etc
- compose full length song in fl studio using ai generated motif and coded instruments
- I can also add more instruments from midi with magenta tone transformer

##No Questions, I'm just curious if this sounds like enough work.
